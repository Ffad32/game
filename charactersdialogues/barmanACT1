Barman: I wouldn’t expect a living soul here that late at night, you must be new into town, right? 
Barman: Tell me, what do you want love? 
Seraphine: Shot of whiskey would be nice.
Seraphine: So tell me, what happens at night?
Barman: You know, rumors..they say that vampires like to wander around here. It’s scaring off the customers, the sales have been low lately. 
Seraphine: Money is tight? I could pay you for some roof over my head. 
Barman: I doubt that you’ll have enough. But if you really mean it, you can open a shop in my name. There’s a market in the center of our kingdom. You can even sell something of your own. You know, look at me, I am an old man, I can’t even stand for 1 minute, let alone 8 hours a day. 
Baraman: Now go to sleep love, you look tired. The room is upstairs.
